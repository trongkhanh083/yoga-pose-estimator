# üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yoga Pose Estimator

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

A sophisticated desktop application that uses computer vision to provide real-time analysis and classification of yoga poses. Built with **OpenCV** for image processing, **MediaPipe** for high-fidelity pose detection, and **CustomTkinter** for a modern user interface.

The application can analyze poses from both a live webcam feed and static images, offering instant feedback to help users improve their form and alignment.

***

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Webcam Analysis:** Get instant pose classification and joint angle feedback from your camera.
* **Static Image Processing:** Upload an image to receive a detailed breakdown of the detected yoga pose.
* **Advanced Pose Classification:** Identifies over 30 distinct yoga poses using a weighted similarity scoring system for enhanced accuracy.
* **Corrective Feedback:** Provides actionable tips (e.g., "Straighten your Left Knee") by comparing your joint angles to ideal reference poses.
* **Modern & Intuitive GUI:** A sleek and user-friendly interface built with CustomTkinter.
* **Save & Export:** Save the processed image with pose landmarks and analysis for future reference.

customtkinter
Pillow
numpy

Installation command:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Application
Bash

python yoga_pose_estimator.py

üìñ How to Use

    Live Camera Feed: Click the "Start Camera" button. A separate window will open showing your camera feed with real-time pose landmarks. The analysis will appear in the "Pose Analysis" section on the left.

    Analyze an Image: Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image file (.jpg, .png, etc.). The processed image will appear in the main visualizer, and the analysis will be displayed on the left.

    Save the Result: After processing an uploaded image, click the "Save Result" button to save a copy of the annotated image.

üì¶ Building the Executable

This project uses PyInstaller to create a single, standalone executable. The build.spec file is already configured.

    Install PyInstaller:
    Bash

pip install pyinstaller

Run the Build Command:
Bash

    pyinstaller build.spec

    The final executable will be located in the dist folder.
