A sophisticated desktop application that uses computer vision to provide real-time analysis and classification of yoga poses. Built with **OpenCV** for image processing, **MediaPipe** for high-fidelity pose detection, and **CustomTkinter** for a modern user interface.

The application can analyze poses from both a live webcam feed and static images, offering instant feedback to help users improve their form and alignment.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Webcam Analysis:** Get instant pose classification and joint angle feedback from your camera.
* **Static Image Processing:** Upload an image to receive a detailed breakdown of the detected yoga pose.
* **Advanced Pose Classification:** Identifies over 30 distinct yoga poses using a weighted similarity scoring system for enhanced accuracy.
* **Corrective Feedback:** Provides actionable tips (e.g., "Straighten your Left Knee") by comparing your joint angles to ideal reference poses.
* **Modern & Intuitive GUI:** A sleek and user-friendly interface built with CustomTkinter.
* **Save & Export:** Save the processed image with pose landmarks and analysis for future reference.
